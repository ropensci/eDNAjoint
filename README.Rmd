The package *eDNAjoint* is useful for interpreting observations from
paired or semi-paired environmental DNA (eDNA) and traditional surveys.
The package runs a Bayesian model that integrates these two data streams
to jointly estimate parameters like the false positive probability of
eDNA detection and expected catch rate at a site. Optional model
variations allow inclusion of site-level covariates that scale the
sensitivity of eDNA sampling relative to traditional sampling, as well
as estimation of gear scaling coefficients when multiple traditional
gear types are used. Additional functions in the package facilitate
interpretation of model fits.

## Installation

The most stable version of *eDNAjoint* can be found on Cran:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("eDNAjoint")
```

You can also install the development version of *eDNAjoint* from
ROpenSci:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("eDNAjoint", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```

## Example

The main functionality in *eDNAjoint* is the use of `joint_model()` that
will fit the model to data. Further functions like `joint_summarize()`
and `detection_calculate()` can be used to help with model fit
interpretation.

This example fits the joint model to data from paired, replicated eDNA
qPCR and seine sampling observations of endangered tidewater gobies
(*Eucyclogobius newberryi*) from a study by Schmelzle and Kinziger
(2016). The following variation of the joint model includes site-level
covariates that scale the sensitivity of eDNA sampling relative to
traditional sampling.

```{r example_1, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
library(eDNAjoint)
data(goby_data)
# run the joint model with two covariates
goby_fit <- joint_model(data = goby_data, cov = c("Filter_time", "Salinity"), 
                        family = "poisson", p10_priors = c(1, 20), q = FALSE)
```

And then this model fit can be accessed to do things like summarize the
posterior distribution for the probability of a false positive
detection, $p_{10}$:

```{r example_2}
# summarize p10 posterior
joint_summarize(goby_fit$model, par = "p10")
```

Or to find the number of eDNA samples and traditional survey samples
necessary to detect presence of the species at a given expected catch
rate:

```{r example_3}
# find the number of samples necessary to detect presence with 0.9 probability 
# at the mean covariate values, if the expected catch rate (mu) is 0.1, 0.5, or 
# 1 individuals/traditional survey unit.
detection_calculate(goby_fit$model, mu = c(0.1, 0.5, 1), 
                    cov_val = c(0, 0), probability = 0.9)
```
